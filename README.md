# Show Initpage Plugin for DokuWiki

If access to a page is denied (i.e. user not logged in), redirect to a defined page.

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:showinitpage

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/showinitpage/ - if the folder is called differently it
will not work!
